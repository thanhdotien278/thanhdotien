1. **Change your mindset**. Clear distractions. Create a plan, and focus on it. Create a proper roadmap for yourself for 2024. Set 3 important goals and don’t switch. Convince your brain to focus only on those goals. It’s about discipline and not motivation.
2. **Realise that focusing on 7 different goals for the next year will get you nowhere in those 7 areas.** Imagine putting all of your energy into 2–3 goals. Imagine the growth you’ll get if you limit working in only those areas of your life. Health is a constant. What 2 other goals are you going to focus on? **The one thing** is what matters.
3. **Don’t manage your time, manage your energy levels**. Experiment, and understand when you work best. Are you an early riser, or a night owl? Not just finding out your optimum energy level times, but knowing how to boost your energy when you’re down is also important. For me, it’s listening to music or going on a walk with my dog.
4. **Clear the clutter around you**. Physically, mentally, and digitally. Remove everything that you know will cause distractions in your work. Maybe it’s unnecessary tasks that have nothing to do with you reaching your goals. Unnecessary people who are not encouraging you. Only keep things that you KNOW will increase your focus.
5. **Create a space to document your learnings**. You read this article. Now what? There has to be an action plan so that you can apply the concepts you feel will be beneficial for you. Decide a platform. Your journal? [Notion](https://thisisananya.gumroad.com/l/othdrv?layout=profile)? Day one? Whatever suits you best. Create one folder called action. Only place notes there that involve you doing something about them. Keep it as minimal as possible.
6. **READ. READ. READ**. Please don’t aim to read 100 books for the next year. Choose 12 books that are right for YOU and your situation. 3 books for soft skills. 3 for hard skills. 3 for entertainment. 3 for self-improvement. Shift this list around to what you think suits you the best. Squeeze out and apply all advice given in the book to the fullest. Move things into the action folder consistently.
7. **Create a roadmap to learn a new skill**. What interests you? Copywriting, coding, UI/UX. Get a course (or search YouTube) and spend only 1 hour on it every day. With the remaining days left for 2024, try and find out what interests you the most. Get excited about it.
8. **Create a plan to take care of** _**yourself**_. Sleep well. Start exercising. Set fitness goals. Quit bad habits. Eat healthy food. Drink enough water. You know the basics, all you need to do is apply. Create a habit tracker with your non-negotiables that are going to help you create a better life for yourself.
9. **Reflect**. Learn more about yourself from the last year. Here’s an excellent [list of in-depth questions](https://medium.com/illumination/end-of-year-reflection-questions-for-the-procrastinating-perfectionist-c028cc57971e) by [Rochelle Deans](https://medium.com/u/52613b96f3c2?source=post\_page-----6c414cc0da6d--------------------------------) to ask yourself.
10. **Get one of those simple task list notepads**. When your productivity system/[dashboard](https://thisisananya.gumroad.com/l/othdrv?layout=profile) gets too overwhelming, it’s better to write down 3 tasks that you have to focus on and get done. Sometimes, this is the best productivity system.
11. Coming to **productivity systems**. If you’re someone who has consumed a lot of content on self-improvement and productivity use 2024 to actually apply it. _Use_ the Ivy-Lee system, _use_ Parkinson's law, apply the _Eat that Frog_ method (a simple-to-understand [article](https://medium.com/twosapp/how-to-eat-the-frog-a-productivity-method-to-improve-focus-and-stop-procrasting-9ca90d96c89c) by [Parker Klein](https://medium.com/u/48050a6d5c3e?source=post\_page-----6c414cc0da6d--------------------------------)).
12. Lastly, **unfollow all unimportant accounts on Instagram or any other social media** you use. Anything that makes you question your worth or cause self-doubt. I’ve created a separate account to follow only people who inspire me, people whom I consider my idols.

You’re not going to see the results in a day, or a week. Consistency is what you need. And until January starts, train your brain. Make it disciplined, and not motivated.

If you start today, there’s a high chance you’ll be able to see progress by the end of the year automatically. Seeing your progress will automatically convince you to work on yourself for the next year.

And with the fresh start effect combined, you’ll be unstoppable for the first month of January. Use this cycle to your advantage.
